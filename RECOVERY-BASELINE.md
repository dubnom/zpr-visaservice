# Compiled baseline recovery candidate

Branch: `recovery/compiled-baseline-20261023`.
Base: `b49842bded73fe581b5a67383fd18734bad55b58`
(`checkpoint-2026-10-16-pre-simulator-admin`).

This candidate restores the checkpoint direction, not the later experimental
Simulator/admin/budget implementation. It does not change the running VM,
shared main, remote branches, or the original dirty worktree.

## Imported changes

The dashboard overlay is content-identical to the isolated recovered dashboard
source as of October 22. Only 21 files differ from the checkpoint:

- Owned-process lifecycle and cleanup for machine workloads, test services and
  stress fleets; do not terminate unrelated processes by executable name.
- Simulator mutation requests use the existing CSRF helper, with deterministic
  script initialization and idempotent initialization across navigation.
- Login UI hides verbose scope details while retaining session-state behavior.
- Direct policy/assertion AI edits validate exact unique original-source anchors,
  reject overlaps/no-ops, and allow one correction within the original output
  budget. Edit requests authorize immediate undoable unsaved changes.
- Regression tests for those changes.

The browser editor bundle and dependency manifests are unchanged. No credential,
private snapshot, executable image, runtime database, or recovered directory is
added to Git.

## What the source does not reproduce yet

The working environment also depends on guest-local recovery provisioning,
organization lifecycle wrappers, generated state, compiler inputs, telemetry
collection and the private DNS statistics relay. Those are preserved with the
cold VM and recovery archives, not hidden as dependencies satisfied by this
source tree.

Some historical companion executable/source mappings remain unproven. A source
build is not evidence that it recreates the exact historical binaries. The
public distribution still requires reviewed seeds, fresh identities, relocatable
configuration, independent setup, and clean-machine installation acceptance.

## Validation

On macOS ARM64 with cached dependencies:

- `GOPROXY=off make test GO=/opt/homebrew/bin/go` was run for both this candidate
  and an untouched checkpoint extracted into a separate directory.
- Candidate has 15 failing top-level tests; all 15 also fail on the checkpoint.
  The checkpoint additionally failed `TestObservabilityWaitsForAssignedAddress`.
  This is baseline comparison evidence, not a passing full-suite claim.
- Failures include absent external organization seeds/manifests/compiler inputs,
  inherited assistant/enrollment contract mismatches, launcher fixture mismatch,
  container-state assumptions, and a Linux ELF artifact expectation.
- Focused recovery/direct-editor/operator-boundary tests pass with `-race`.
- Complete `internal/assistant`, `internal/controlservice/inventory` and
  `internal/dnsstats` tests pass.
- `node --test scripts/operator-request.test.mjs` passes.
- `go build ./...` passes; the web runtime cross-compiles for Linux ARM64.
- `git diff --check` passes.

No tests were weakened or rewritten to hide the inherited failures. All test
failures must be dispositioned before promoting this candidate. The candidate
binary has not replaced any live executable and has not passed the full
seventeen-scenario/browser suite in a fresh environment.

## Adapter retention and main promotion

Core is a separate repository. Its adapter development is preserved at
`archive/adapter-work-before-baseline-20261023` pointing to
`4e82d14f767a` (resolve the full revision in that repository).
Retain and review independently:

- macOS TUN configuration/readiness and installer work;
- reusable cancellable adapter lifecycle;
- Windows portability and Wintun work;
- iOS packet-flow/FFI groundwork;
- related peer/Visa reliability and tests.

Preservation is not approval of every change or proof of platform readiness.
Do not merge unrelated newer Simulator work to obtain adapter improvements.

Promotion gates:

1. Establish a self-contained build/runtime manifest and seed provenance.
2. Reconcile missing fixtures and inherited failures without copying private state.
3. Validate a compiled candidate in a new isolated environment.
4. Run all five organizations/seventeen scenarios and operator acceptance.
5. Review the candidate against main, then choose a forward restoration commit
   or an explicitly approved history rewrite. Preserve newer refs and dirty work.

No remote/main cutover is part of this candidate checkpoint.
